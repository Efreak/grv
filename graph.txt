type Graph struct {

type GraphRow struct {

type GraphNodeType int

const (

type GraphNode struct {
	nodeType GraphNodeType

Need to leave a column between each branch e.g.

M-|-|-

Line needs to be split out into the different options it could be. e.g.

Continuation
Merge e.g URCORNER
Branch e.g. LRCORNER

Merge is easy to detect.
Branching off is harder - Need to check if any of the nodes in a row share the same commit ID
